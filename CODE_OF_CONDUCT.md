# Kusanagi Night Ops Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to all porjects in the Kusanagi Night Ops Series, including their repositories, issues, pull requests, discussions, and any related community spaces.

Kusanagi Night Ops is focused on security tooling and red team research. Because this work can touch sensitive topics (offensive security, adversary simulation, red team tradecraft), we hold ourselves to a high standard of professionalism and responsibility.

By participating in these projects, you agree to follow this Code of Conduct.

## 1. Our Values

We aim to build a community that is:

- **Respectful** – Treat others with dignity, even when you disagree.
- **Inclusive** – No discrimination or harassment based on background, identity, or experience.
- **Constructive** – Critique code and ideas, not people.
- **Curious and honest** – Share knowledge, ask questions, and be open about limitations and risks.
- **Responsible in security work** – Prioritize safety, legality, and the protection of others.

## 2. Expected Behavior

When engaging with Kusanagi Night Ops projects, you are expected to:

- **Be respectful and professional**
  - Use welcoming and inclusive language.
  - Assume good intent, but acknowledge impact if someone raises a concern.

- **Keep discussions focused on technical and research topics**
  - Provide clear, actionable feedback on issues and pull requests.
  - Avoid personal attacks, flame wars, or off-topic drama.

- **Use security tooling and research responsibly**
  - Discuss and demonstrate techniques in a way that encourages **authorized** and **ethical** use only.
  - Clearly note when examples or scenarios are hypothetical, lab-based, or intentionally anonymized.

- **Protect sensitive information**
  - Do **not** share real-world credentials, private data, or non-public vulnerabilities belonging to organizations without their consent.
  - If you discover a security issue related to a Kusanagi Night Ops project itself, follow responsible disclosure (see reporting below).

- **Collaborate in good faith**
  - Attribute work where appropriate.
  - Respect project maintainers’ decisions, scope, and roadmap.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not acceptable anywhere in the Kusanagi Night Ops ecosystem:

- **Harassment or discrimination**
  - Offensive comments related to race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, religion, or age.
  - Threats of violence or encouraging self-harm.
  - Unwanted sexual attention or advances.

- **Abusive conduct**
  - Personal insults, name-calling, or sustained disruption of discussions.
  - Doxxing (publishing others’ private or identifying information without consent).

- **Encouraging or facilitating illegal activity**
  - Advocating for the use of these tools for **unauthorized access**, data theft, ransomware, or other criminal activity.
  - Sharing real-world targets or “hit lists” for unauthorized testing.
  - Posting instructions that are clearly framed for abuse against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.

- **Sharing sensitive real-world data**
  - Non-public logs, customer data, internal source code, or proprietary configurations belonging to other organizations, unless you have the right to share them and they are clearly anonymized.

If you are unsure whether something is appropriate, err on the side of caution and ask a maintainer.

## 4. Security & Legal Boundaries

Kusanagi Night Ops tools are intended for:

- Personal labs and learning environments.
- Systems and applications you own.
- Systems where you have explicit, written authorization to test (e.g., internal testing programs, bug bounty targets within scope).

They are **not** intended for, and must not be used for, unauthorized or illegal activity.

When discussing or contributing to these projects:

- Use **generic or lab-based examples** where possible.
- Avoid naming real organizations or systems unless they are clearly part of a public, authorized testing program and you follow their rules.
- Do not request assistance for active, unauthorized operations.

## 5. Reporting Concerns

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, or have concerns about how these tools are being discussed or used in this community, please report it to Github.


- A description of what happened.
- Links, screenshots, or message excerpts if applicable.
- Whether you prefer your report to remain confidential.

## 6. Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. They have the right and responsibility to take appropriate action, including but not limited to:

- Asking a participant to edit or remove problematic content.
- Issuing verbal or written warnings.
- Temporarily or permanently banning individuals from issues, pull requests, or other project spaces.
- Locking or moderating threads that are not following this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers will strive to:

- Be fair and consistent.
- Listen to all sides where possible.
- Prioritize the safety and well-being of the community.

## 7. Acknowledgements

This Code of Conduct is inspired by common open-source community practices and codes of conduct used across the security and software engineering ecosystems.

By participating in Kusanagi Night Ops projects, you agree to uphold these guidelines and help keep the community respectful, professional, and responsible—especially given the sensitive nature of security tooling and research.
